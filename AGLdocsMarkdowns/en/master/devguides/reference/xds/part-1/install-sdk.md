# AGL SDKs

To build your AGL services or AGL applications using XDS,
you must install a Software Development Kit (SDK) that
matches your target/board.

An SDK is a package that includes all the tools you need
to cross-build and cross-debug your service or application.
You install an SDK by running the SDK Installer.

You can build an AGL SDK Installer for your board or you can download
a pre-built installer.

This section describes how you can download a pre-built SDK
Installer using either the command line or the XDS Dashboard.
For information on how to build an SDK Installer, see the
"[Download or Build Your SDK Installer](../../../../getting_started/reference/getting-started/app-workflow-sdk.html)"
section.

<!-- section-note -->
**NOTES:**
- In order to use the command line or the XDS Dashboard
  to download an SDK Installer, you must
  have the XDS UI set up in your toolchain (i.e. 'xds-cli').
  If you did not install 'xds-cli', see the
  "[Client Part](client-part.html)" section for instruction on how
  to install XDS UI.

- See the
  "[xds-server](../part-2/1_xds-server/0_abstract.html)" chapter
  for more information on SDK management.

## Command Line Operations

This section describes how to download and install an SDK,
abort an installation, install an SDK from a local directory,
and view all installed SDKs.

### Download and Install an SDK Using the Command Line

Use the following commands to choose and install a pre-built SDK
Installer:

```bash
# List all available SDKs
xds-cli sdks ls -a

```

### Abort an Installation that is in Progress

If for some reason you need to abort an ongoing installation, you can
use the `sdks abort` command:

```bash
xds-cli sdks abort -id d65fe750
```

### Install an SDK Using a Local SDK Package or File

If you have an SDK Installer that is already local to your system,
you can use the command line to install it from your local directory:

```bash
xds-cli sdks install --file $HOME/xds-workspace/sdks/poky-agl-glibc-x86_64-agl-demo-platform-crosssdk-corei7-64-toolchain-4.99.5.sh
```

<!-- section-note -->
**NOTE:**
Installation based on a local SDK Installer is only supported when the
SDK Installer is in the `$HOME/xds-workspace/sdks` directory.
<!-- end-section-note -->

### List Installed SDKs

To list the installed SDKs, use the following command:

```bash
xds-cli sdks ls

List of installed SDKs:
ID       NAME                                            STATUS          VERSION ARCH
e45ac787 AGL-corei7-64-4.99.5+snapshot                   Installed       4.99.5  x86_64

```

## Install an SDK Using the XDS Dashboard

Follow these steps to locate, download, and install an SDK
using the XDS Dashboard:

1. Open the XDS Dashboard in a Web Browser and select
   `SDKs` in left-hand menu.

2. Switch to `SDKs MANAGEMENT` view.
   Following is an example:

   ![](../part-1/pictures/xds-dashboard-sdks-mgt.png){:: style="margin:auto; display:flex"}

3. Use filter boxes to find the SDK you want to install.

4. Click on the "plus" icon in the "Actions" column to
   start the installation.

   The SDK Installer downloads and the installation process begins.
   In can take several minutes for the installation to complete.
   Following is an example of the output:

   ![](../part-1/pictures/xds-dashboard-sdks-install.png){:: style="margin:auto; display:flex"}

## Aborting an SDK Installation

If for some reason you need to abort an ongoing SDK installation,
you can do so by clicking the `CANCEL` button.
