# Build Using the Command Line

One option for building your application using XDS is to use
the command line (i.e. `xds-cli`).
Building the application consists of declaring your project, identifying
some key ID values, and then using the command line to build it.

<!-- section-note -->
**NOTE:**

XDS tools, including `xds-cli`, are installed by default in
the `/opt/AGL/bin` directory.
During installation, this directory is automatically added to your
`PATH` variable.
If, for some reason, the tool is not in your `PATH` directory,
you can manually add it using the `export PATH=${PATH}:/opt/AGL/bin`
command.
<!-- end-section-note -->


## Declare Project

Use the `projects add` command to declare your project:

```bash
xds-cli prj add --label="Project_helloworld-native-application" --type=pm --path=/home/seb/xds-workspace/helloworld-native-application --server-path=/home/devel/xds-workspace/helloworld-native-application
```

When you declare the project, XDS creates the `xds-project.conf`
configuration file if one does not already exist.
You should examine this configuration file before you build the
project to be sure all configurations are correct for your project.

<!-- section-note -->
**NOTE:**

If the Server Part (i.e. `xds-agent`) is not running on the default
port, you can use the `--url=http://localhost:<port>` option with the
`xds-cli prj add` command to specify the port.
Just substitute the actual port for `<port>` with the option.
<!-- end-section-note -->

## Determine the ID of Your Project

After declaring your project, you need to determine the
unique ID of your project.

From the command line, use the `prj ls` command, which is an abbreviation
for the `projects list` command:

```bash
xds-cli prj ls
ID                                       Label                                   LocalPath
f9904f70-d441-11e7-8c59-3c970e49ad9b     Project_helloworld-service              /home/seb/xds-workspace/helloworld-service
4021617e-ced0-11e7-acd2-3c970e49ad9b     Project_helloworld-native-application   /home/seb/xds-workspace/helloworld-native-application
```

Once you have the ID of the project, you can use the `--id` option
or the `XDS_PROJECT_ID` environment variable to refer to your project.

<!-- section-note -->
**NOTE:**

When using the project ID from the command line, you can use the "short"
notation by providing a non-ambiguous portion of the ID.
For example, to refer to the `Project_helloworld-native-application` project
shown in the previous example, you can use `-id 40` rather than
`--id 40 instead of --id 4021617e-ced0-11e7-acd2-3c970e49ad9b`.
<!-- end-section-note -->

## Determine the ID of Your SDK

You also need to determine the ID of the SDK you want to use to cross-build
your application.

To list installed SDKs, use the following command:

```bash
xds-cli sdks ls
List of installed SDKs:
  ID                                    NAME
  7aa19224-b769-3463-98b1-4c029d721766  aarch64  (3.99.1+snapshot)
  41a1efc4-8443-3fb0-afe5-8313e0c96efd  corei7-64  (3.99.2+snapshot)
  c226821b-b5c0-386d-94fe-19f807946d03  aarch64  (3.99.3)
```

SDK IDs are returned by architecture and version.
Be sure to identify the SDK you need.

## Build the Application

You can now use XDS to cross-build your project.
Following is an example that builds a project that is based on CMake:

```bash
# First, export the target IP address, or it's DNS name
export TARGET_ADDRESS=<target_adress>

# Go into your project directory and create a build directory
cd $MY_PROJECT_DIR
mkdir build
```

Before using the command line to build the project, you should be
sure the project's configuration file is correct.
Examine the `xds-project.conf` configuration file and edit it
as needed.

Generate the build system using CMake:

```
# You must set RSYNC_* variables so that you deploy and populate widgets on the target
xds-cli exec --id=4021617e --sdkid=c226821b -- "export RSYNC_TARGET=root@${TARGET_ADDRESS} ; export RSYNC_PREFIX=/opt ; cd build && cmake .."
```

Now you can build the project:

```
xds-cli exec --id=4021617e --sdkid=c226821b -- "cd build && make widget"
```

<!-- section-note -->
**NOTE:**

If you use `&&`, `||` or `;` statements in the executed command line,
you need to double quote the command (e.g. `"cd build && make"`).
<!-- end-section-note -->

To avoid having to set the project ID, SDK ID, and URL for each
command line, you can define these settings as environment variables
using an environment file.
Use the `--config` option or source file before executing
the `xds-cli` command.

To specify your configuration file with the command line,
use the `--config` option.
For example, the equivalent of the previous build command but
with a specified configuration file is as follows:

```bash
# MY_PROJECT_DIR=/home/seb/xds-workspace/helloworld-native-application
cd $MY_PROJECT_DIR

# Edit and potentially adapt xds-project.conf file that has been created
# automatically on project declaration using XDS Dashboard
cat xds-project.conf
  # XDS project settings
  export XDS_AGENT_URL=localhost:8800
  export XDS_PROJECT_ID=4021617e-ced0-11e7-acd2-3c970e49ad9b
  export XDS_SDK_ID=c226821b-b5c0-386d-94fe-19f807946d03

# Create build directory and invoke cmake and then build project
xds-cli exec --config=./xds-project.conf -- "mkdir -p build && cd build && cmake .."
cd build && xds-cli exec --config=../xds-project.conf -- "make all"
```

Alternatively, you could first source the configuration file to avoid using the
`--config` option as follows:

```
source xds-project.conf
xds-cli exec "mkdir -p build && cd build && cmake .."
cd build && xds-cli exec "make all"
```

**NOTE:**

All parameters after a double dash (`--`) are considered as the command
to execute.
