# xds-gdb: wrapper on gdb for XDS

`xds-gdb` is a wrapper on gdb debugger for X(cross) Development System.

This tool allows you to debug an application built with an xds-server without
the need to install gdb or any cross tool.

Two debugging models are supported:

1. native debugging

1. XDS remote debugging requiring an XDS agent/server setup. That allows you to
    easily cross debug your application.

 By default XDS debug model is used and you need to define `XDS_NATIVE_GDB`
variable to use native gdb debug mode instead.
