# XDS Server Test

## XDS Server test architecture

The test part is written in go and source code is available in test directory.

```bash
|
+-- test/                # where xds-server test source files
|
+-- test/main_test.go    # main entry point of xds-server test
|
+-- test/fixtures        # fixtures for running test
```

The test execution will locally launch xds-server and access the api through REST and test results, events, ...

## Dependencies

* sshd

Make sure sshd is in your user PATH.

## Launch test

Use the following command to launch test in xds-server root directory:

```bash
make test
```

Launch only one test, for example launch TestSdks:

```bash
make test name=TestSdks
```

Increase test verbosity:

```bash
make test VERBOSE=1
```
