# Start-up

## Start-up based on systemd user service

For **Linux** distro, XDS agent can be started as a user service by Systemd.

```bash
/usr/lib/systemd/user/xds-agent.service
```

Use well-known systemd commands to control `xds-agent.service` service.

```bash
# Status XDS agent:
systemctl --user status xds-agent

# Start XDS agent
systemctl --user start xds-agent

# Stop XDS agent
systemctl --user stop xds-agent
```

Default settings are defined in  `/etc/default/xds-agent` file but these
settings you can overwritten by `$HOME/.xds/agent/agent-config.json` file,
see [Configuration chapter](./2_config.html) for more details.

## Manual start-up

On **Linux or MacOS**, simply execute `xds-agent` executable:

```bash
/opt/AGL/bin/xds-agent
```

On **Windows**, simply execute `xds-agent` executable (root path may change
depending where you installed/unzipped xds-agent tarball):

```batch
C:\AGL\bin\xds-agent.exe
```

<!-- section-note -->
**Note:**

If need be, you can increase log level by setting option
`--log <level>`, supported *level* are: panic, fatal, error, warn, info, debug.

Invoke `xds-agent --help` to get more details about possible options that allow
for example to change logging level or select a specific configuration file.
