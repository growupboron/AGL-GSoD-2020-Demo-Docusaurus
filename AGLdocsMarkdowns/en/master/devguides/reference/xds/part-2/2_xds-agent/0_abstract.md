# XDS - X(cross) Development System Agent

XDS-agent is a client that should run on your local / user development machine when you use XDS.

This agent takes care, among others, of starting [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)
tool to synchronize your project files from your local host to XDS build server
machine or container (where `xds-server` is running).

> **SEE ALSO**: [xds-server](https://gerrit.automotivelinux.org/gerrit/gitweb?p=src/xds/xds-server.git), a web server
used to remotely cross build applications.
