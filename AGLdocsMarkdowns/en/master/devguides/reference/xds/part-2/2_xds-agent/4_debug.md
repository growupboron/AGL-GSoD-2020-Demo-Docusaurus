# Debugging

## XDS agent architecture

The agent part is written in *Go* and the webapp / dashboard is in *typescript + Angular4*.

```bash
|
+-- bin/                where xds-server binary file will be built
|
+-- conf.d              Linux configuration and startup files (systemd user service)
|
+-- glide.yaml          Go package dependency file
|
+-- lib/                sources of server part (Go)
|
+-- main.go             main entry point of of Web server (Go)
|
+-- Makefile            makefile including
|
+-- README.md           readme
|
+-- scripts/            hold various scripts used for installation or startup
|
+-- tools/              temporary directory to hold development tools (like glide)
|
+-- vendor/             temporary directory to hold Go dependencies packages
|
+-- webapp/             source client basic webapp / dashboard
```

## Debug xds-agent (Go code)

Install first [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and
[Go plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lukehoban.Go)
(`ext install lukehoban.Go`)

Visual Studio Code launcher settings can be found into `.vscode/launch.json`.
The important think is to correctly set `GOPATH` in launch.json in order to
build xds-agent and debug it within Visual Studio Code.

Here is an example of launch.json:

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [{
            "name": "XDS-Agent",
            "type": "go",
            "request": "launch",
            "mode": "debug",
            "remotePath": "",
            "port": 2345,
            "host": "127.0.0.1",
            "program": "${workspaceRoot}",
            "env": {
                "GOPATH": "${workspaceRoot}/../../../../../..:${env:GOPATH}",
            },
            "args": ["-log", "debug", "-c", "__agent-config_local_dev.json"],
            "showLog": false
        }
    ]
}
```

And `__agent-config_local_dev.json` file content is as follow :

```json
{
    "webAppDir": "./webapp/dist",
    "logsDir": "${HOME}/tmp/xds-agent/logs",
    "xdsServers": [
        {
          "url": "http://localhost:8000"
        }
    ],
    "syncthing": {
        "binDir": "./bin",
        "home": "${HOME}/tmp/xds_local_dev/syncthing-config",
        "gui-address": "http://localhost:8386",
    }
}
```

### Tricks to debug both xds-agent and xds-server

To debug both `xds-agent` and `xds-server` or common code `xds-common`, it may
be useful use the same local sources.

A trick to do that is to replace `xds-server` + `xds-common` in `vendor`
directory by a symlink that points to local sources.

So clone first `xds-server` + `xds-common` sources next to `xds-agent` directory.

You should have the following tree:

```bash
tree -L 5 src/
src/
`-- gerrit.automotivelinux.org
    `-- gerrit
        `-- src
            `-- xds
                |-- xds-agent
                |-- xds-common
                `-- xds-server
```

Then invoke `vendor/debug` Makefile rule to create symbolic links inside vendor
directory :

```bash
cd src/gerrit.automotivelinux.org/gerrit/src/xds/xds-agent
make vendor/debug
```

## Debug dashboard part (Typescript / angular code)

Start `xds-agent` either from command line or in debug mode (see previous
chapter) and in another terminal start a watcher daemon so that type typescript
sources of webapp / dashboard are automatically "transpiled" using following
command :

```bash
cd webapp
npm run watch
```

Then open the XDS Dashboard page ([http://localhost:8800](http://localhost:8800))
and open the developer tool of web browser (for example `Ctrl+Shift+I` in Chrome).
